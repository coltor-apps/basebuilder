## Intro

Basebuilder is a versatile TypeScript SDK designed for crafting custom form builders and much more. You can also develop website builders, dashboard builders, and any other builders you envision.

Some key characteristics:

- Headless: Bring your own components and design the user experience as you want.
- Full-stack: Provides comprehensive tools for building both the interface and validate schemas on the back-end.
- Typesafe: Ensures full type safety by default in every aspect.
- Multi-platform: Runs on web, mobile, servers, serverless environments, and edge computing.
- Framework agnostic: Features a core that is independent of any front-end framework.
- Zero dependencies: Offers a streamlined, lightweight library.
- Unopinionated: Affords you the freedom to build anything you imagine.
- Progressively Enhanceable: Embraces web standards.

Currently, Basebuilder offers support for React, with plans to extend compatibility to other front-end frameworks in the future.

We are successfully using Basebuilder in real-world production apps. However, it's important to note that the project is currently in the alpha stage, which means that breaking changes can occur even in minor or patch updates.
